### Part2 - Simulating a simple pedestrian flow

#### (a) Subway Enterance

The subway enterance example was created with boundaries, walls, entrance and exit, including faregates before exit to train as shown in the figures below for entrance rate of 1000 per min.

Adding 3d,

And adding faregates, displayed with density map,

The entrance frequency was increased to 14,000 per minute and the back up and lines were visible as demonstrated in the below two figures:
